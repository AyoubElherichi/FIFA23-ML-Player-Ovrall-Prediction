# FIFA23-ML-Player-Ovrall-Prediction
In this project, we will build a machine learning model to predict the (OVRALL) rating of a football player based on their individual attributes. We will use the complete FIFA 23 player dataset to train our model.
<br><br>We will explore machine learning techniques such as linear regression and decision tree regression to anticipate player performance. This prediction can have significant applications in the fields of scouting, team building, and individual player performance analysis.
